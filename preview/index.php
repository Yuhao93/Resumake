            <p>Typically, the process of making an online resume is long and expensive. Creating a professional looking website is hard and time-consuming. In order to do it well, you have to invest a lot of time that could be spent doing other things.</p>
            <p>To host up your webpage, you need server space. This can be achieved through a free website making service that creates an unprofessional and unnattractive website or through renting or buying server space, which can often times be expensive.</p>
            <p>Resumake makes it easy to host an online resume. We don't charge you any fee for hosting your resume and we streamline your resume making process. You can even import your profile from LinkedIn to make the process even easier</p>
